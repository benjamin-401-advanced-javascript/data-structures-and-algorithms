# Multi Bracket Validation
This function takes a string as an argument, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.

## Challenge
find out if these brackets '{}(){}' open and close in a balanced way

## Approach & Efficiency
I just pushed them onto a stack as I came across them and ignored every  other type of character
